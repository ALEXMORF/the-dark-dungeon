# the-dark-dungeon
a game with the application of raycasting.

All the game code and render code is coded by hand with only a few libraries. The render code is written without external libraries, but the asset loading does use external libraries, since it's a bit tricky.

libraries being used:
1. stb_image.h 
 
existing features:
 1. texture mapping for wall rendering. 
 2. floor & ceiling casting along with texture mapping.

currently working on: Sprite rendering. (Renderer)
